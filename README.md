# IT-Internship
My internship project so far at an industrial company in St. Louis

My mentor is a database manager at this company. One of his projects is converting the store procedures from  SQL to Java. He outlined for me ways that the names changed based on what they were used for. For example, there were Com, Frm, and Rpt store procedures. He wanted me to look at several forms using the Microsoft Access app and then go into the SQL database manager application (I believe) and change the name of the file using Find and Replace and also change my name and the date created. The number of store procedures were in the thousands. Instead of doing that, I wrote a program for it. I started the program last Thursday, finished up the OOP part on Friday, and began the main program on Friday. The project isn't finished, but it can do individual files-- it just can't loop through a folder of files yet.
